check whether the nums contain inside the array 
[1,2, 3, 4] -> return true  [1, 2, 3, 3, 1] -> return false 

1. brute force sol will be check one number and compare it with the other numbers 
    this will be O(n)2

2. Another sol is to sort the array and check the adj number is same as previous 
    for sorting complexity will be (logn) and for iterating (n) so the O(nlogn)

3. More compact solution will be using extra space we can use one Hashset and check whether 
    the numbers from array contains inside the Hashset complexity will be O(n) space will be O(n)
