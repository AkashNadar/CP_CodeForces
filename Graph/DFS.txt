1. In the DFS we will be traversing through the depth of the graph also we need to observe that it is an 
    zero based indexing graph.
2. So for this we will be using recursion 
3. we need to have a array list to keep the track of visited node .
4. on the recursion we need to put a condition for the visited node to not to traverse on that node .
5. Depending on the adjaceny list it will be decided to traverse left side or right side.
